# EZ Works - Frontend Assignment (React + Vite + Tailwind)

This is a ready-to-run starter project for the EZ Works Frontend Intern assignment.
It contains a single-page React app (Vite), Tailwind setup, responsive layout, and a Contact Form integrated to the required API endpoint.

## Features
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Responsive single-page layout (Hero + Contact Form)
- Contact form: frontend validation, loading state, POST to https://vernanbackend.ezlab.in/api/contact-us/
- Reset button and status messages
- Easy to deploy on Vercel/Netlify

## How to run locally
1. Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) and npm installed.
2. Open terminal and run:
```bash
cd ez-works-assignment
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Deployment
- Deploy the folder to Vercel or Netlify. Vercel will automatically detect Vite and deploy with `npm run build`.

## What to submit
- GitHub repository link (push the folder)
- Live deployment link (Vercel/Netlify)
- Postman collection / screenshot proving contact form POST (optional)

Good luck! If you want, I can:
- push this to a GitHub repo for you (I can provide git commands)
- deploy it to Vercel and give exact steps
- customize colors/typography to match the Figma more closely
